## Introduction

The Arduino Vacuum Cleaner is a floor cleaning robot that uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and avoid them while cleaning. It utilizes the vacuum motor to suck up dirt and dust from the floor surface. The Bluetooth module enables wireless control and monitoring of the robot.

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Vacuum motor
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
- Motor driver (if required)
- Power supply
- Wheels and chassis for the robot

## Circuit Diagram

Include a circuit diagram here that illustrates how the components are connected to the Arduino board. You can use software like Fritzing or draw the diagram manually.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the Arduino code (`vacuum_cleaner.ino`) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.
4. Connect your smartphone or computer to the Bluetooth module of the Arduino.
5. Power on the vacuum cleaner robot.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the vacuum cleaner robot and any additional details, such as:

- How to control the robot using the Bluetooth module.
- Any specific cleaning patterns or modes.
- Precautions and safety instructions.
